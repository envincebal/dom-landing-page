# JavaScript Landing Page 

## Instructions

To view app, download the files to your desktop and open index.html. Otherwise click [HERE](https://envincebal.github.io/dom-landing-page/).

## Summary

This is a responsive landing page built using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript with a focus on DOM manipulation. The navigation bar is dynamically created whenever a new section in the landing page body has been added. Active states to highlight which section is being viewed have been added to the navbar.

## Acknowledgments

Starter code for the HTML and CSS files came from Udacity as part of the Front End Nanodegree. I modified those files to give my own style.
